# Spring Revival in the Mid-Hills of the Himalaya: A Socioeconomic Assessment Using Benefit–Cost Analysis

\
*Authors :G.Butte, K.Khadka, A.Aldinucci, B.Macaulay, S.Buchar*

This page is a visual narration based of the article we wrote on an socio-economic valuation of spring revival activities in Nepal.

Given that academic writing is usually not the most popular mean of communication, I tried to explore the possibility of summarising the article in a more approachable visual format. Enjoy!

[Context]{.high} The Himalaya is usually associated with high mountains, covered in perennial glaciers. Water sources are therefore understood as being of glacial origin. [@cr-himal]

From a water perspective, mountains have been defined as "water towers" because they capture water, store and release water by gravity to lower areas.[@cr-himal2]

In reality, there is a lower area, referred as *mid-hills* that is composed of mountain that reach 2500m and more, that do not host glacier nor can access glacial water. [@cr-himal3]

Population in these areas uses water from mountain springs or, in some cases, by pumping from water bodies present at the bottom of the valley.

In recent years, mountain springs have been found declining across the Himalaya. For this purpose revival activities have been designed and implemented. @cr-revival

Our research tried to run a cost-benefit analysis on these revival activities with two case study in Nepal and two more generic scenarios.

Costs were identified by looking at records of the revival activities carried in the two study sites. @cr-costs

The biggest cost comes from the hydro-geological mapping of the "water tower" (C_lab_wt). This means that reviving several springs within the same water tower can reduce costs because of the economy of scale.

Benefits were identified using previous research and conducting focus group in the communities living near the springs. [@cr-causal]

Then we transformed the findings into equations to estimate the benefits in monetary terms. In our scenarios, the main benefit was generated from time saving followed by ecosystem benefits. [@cr-benefits]

In three out of the four scenarios, benefits over-passed costs (Benefit Cost Ratio above one). This suggests that spring revivals are likely to be a valuable investment also from economic perspective. [@cr-bcr]

The fact that in one scenario (BHA) costs were higher than benefits shows that revived springs need to be used by the community.

This study, should be replicated in several other sites since the impact of a water spring is highly dependent on local context. Despite this limitation, it shows that spring revival can be a solutions that also brings economic benefits.
