    "text": "Authors :G.Butte, K.Khadka, A.Aldinucci, B.Macaulay, S.Buchar\nThis page is a visual narration based of the article we wrote on an socio-economic valuation of spring revival activities in Nepal.\nGiven that academic writing is usually not the most popular mean of communication, I tried to explore the possibility of summarising the article in a more approachable visual format. Enjoy!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContext The Himalaya is usually associated with high mountains, covered in perennial glaciers. Water sources are therefore understood as being of glacial origin.\n\n\n\n\nFrom a water perspective, mountains have been defined as “water towers” because they capture water, store and release water by gravity to lower areas.\n\n\n\n\nIn reality, there is a lower area, referred as mid-hills that is composed of mountain that reach 2500m and more, that do not host glacier nor can access glacial water.\n\n\n\n\nPopulation in these areas uses water from mountain springs or, in some cases, by pumping from water bodies present at the bottom of the valley.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n  \n  \n  \n    \n    \n    Storage\n    Downhill delivery\n    Precipitation\n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n  \n  \n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n    Storage\n    Downhill delivery\n    Mid-hills\n    Too low for glaciers,too high for rivers\n    Precipitation\n    \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn recent years, mountain springs have been found declining across the Himalaya. For this purpose revival activities have been designed and implemented.\n\n\n\n\nOur research tried to run a cost-benefit analysis on these revival activities with two case study in Nepal and two more generic scenarios.\n\n\n\n\nCosts were identified by looking at records of the revival activities carried in the two study sites.\n\n\n\n\nThe biggest cost comes from the hydro-geological mapping of the “water tower” (C_lab_wt). This means that reviving several springs within the same water tower can reduce costs because of the economy of scale.\n\n\n\n\nBenefits were identified using previous research and conducting focus group in the communities living near the springs.\n\n\n\n\nThen we transformed the findings into equations to estimate the benefits in monetary terms. In our scenarios, the main benefit was generated from time saving followed by ecosystem benefits.\n\n\n\n\nIn three out of the four scenarios, benefits over-passed costs (Benefit Cost Ratio above one). This suggests that spring revivals are likely to be a valuable investment also from economic perspective.\n\n\n\n\nThe fact that in one scenario (BHA) costs were higher than benefits shows that revived springs need to be used by the community.\n\n\n\n\nThis study, should be replicated in several other sites since the impact of a water spring is highly dependent on local context. Despite this limitation, it shows that spring revival can be a solutions that also brings economic benefits."
