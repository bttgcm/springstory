Enjoy!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContext The Himalaya is usually associated with high mountains, covered in perennial glaciers. Water sources are therefore understood as being of glacial origin.\n\n\n\n\nFrom a water perspective, mountains have been defined as “water towers” because they capture water, store and release water by gravity to lower areas.\n\n\n\n\nIn reality, there is a lower area, referred as mid-hills that is composed of mountain that reach 2500m and more, that do not host glacier nor can access glacial water.\n\n\n\n\nPopulation in these areas uses water from mountain springs or, in some cases, by pumping from water bodies present at the bottom of the valley.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n  \n  \n  \n    \n    \n    Storage\n    Downhill delivery\n    Precipitation\n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n  \n  \n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n    Storage\n    Downhill delivery\n    Mid-hills\n    Too low for glaciers,too high for rivers\n    Precipitation\n    \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn recent years, mountain springs have been found declining across the Himalaya. For this purpose revival activities have been designed and implemented.research tried to run a cost-benefit analysis on these revival activities with two case study in Nepal and two more generic scenarios.\n\n\n\n\nCosts were identified by looking at records of the revival activities carried in the two study sites.The biggest cost comes from the hydro-geological mapping of the “water tower” (C_lab_wt).\n\n\n\n\nSince cost of mapping are shared across all the springs, reviving several springs can reduce the cost per spring.\n\n\n\n\nCost of implementation (labour and material) are rather minimal.\n\n\n\n\nProject costs such as management (C_lab), cost of capital (C_fin) and operation and management (C_om) play a role in the overall resource need.\n\n\n\n\nIn one scenario the operation costs was significantly higher due to the installation of a water pump.\n\n\n\n\nMapping benefits was more challenging. We used published research, direct observations and focus groups in the communities living near the springs.\n\n\n\n\nA first group of benefits comes from the increase of water flow.\n\n\n\n\nIn some cases, revived springs become an additional water source. This can bring ecosystem benefits and release tensions for water allocation.\n\n\n\n\nLastly, the project itself can bring benefits in terms of capabilities.\n\n\n\n\nBenefits from time saving were estimated as the highest.\n\n\n\n\nFollowed by ecosystem benefits that would be very context dependent.\n\n\n\n\nSome benefits related to agricultural production due to increased water were also found.\n\n\n\n\nLastly, health benefits from access to clean water.\n\n\n\n\nThe comparison between costs and benefits showed that in 3 out of 4 scenarios, benefits were higher.\n\n\n\n\nIn one scenario (BHA) costs were higher than benefits due to the low usage of the spring.\n\n\n\n\nUsing more common parameters as Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR) and Internal rate of return (IRR) showed promising results.\n\n\n\n\nThis study, should be replicated in several other sites since the impact of a water spring is highly dependent on local context. Despite this limitation, it shows that spring revival can be a solutions that also brings economic benefits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
